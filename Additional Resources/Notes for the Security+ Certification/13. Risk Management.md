# Risk Management
## 13.1 Organizational Security Policies
* Policy Documents: Documents designed to describe the organization's cybersecurity program and policies
  * These include: Policies, Standards, Procedures, and Guidelines
* Policies: High-level statements about management intent. Nothing specific and is created by high-level company execs.
  * Includes: Information security policy, AUP, governance policy, credentials management policies, password policy, monitoring policy, code of ethics, and asset management.
* Standards: Mandatory requirements about how the policies will be carried out and controls put in place.
* Procedures: Detailed step-by-step processes that individuals and organizations must follow in specific circumstances.
* Guidelines: Provide best practices and recommendations for tasks
</br></br></br>
* Personal Policies Examples:
  * Background checks: criminal records, credit reports, drug testing, ID verification, social media analysis
  * Onboarding: The process of onboarding a new person to the company
  * Non-disclosure agreement
  * Non-compete agreement
  * Security Training
  * Separation of duties
  * Job rotation
  * Principle of least privilege
  * Admin account uses and standards
  * mandatory vacations
  * Fraud prevention
  * Collusion
  * Offboarding
</br></br></br>
* Vendors: Company that sells and organization goods or services they need
* Supply Chain: Collaborative Partnership where companies work together to get to a shared operational objective.
* Business Partner: An agreement between businesses to operate a business together and share profits.
* Onboarding Considerations: Security Policies, incident response procedures, security controls, audit policies, security posture
* Service Level Agreement (SLA): Specifies services of a third party and level of guaranteed performance
* Blanket Purchase Order (BPO): Ongoing agreement with a third party to provide services on an ongoing basis. Usually created with lowered pricing
* Memorandum of Understanding (MOU): Summary of who is doing what tasks and when - this is less legally binding and is just an agreement.
* Interconnections Security Agreement (ISA): How connected businesses will share data securely
* NDA: where a group/user agrees not to share information gathered during the completion of work
* Measurement System Analysis (MSA): Measurements taken to determine the quality of service received.
* Ongoing Tasks: Verify compliance, assess vulnerabilities, audit security, share finding
* Offboarding responsibilities: Disables shared communication, domain trusts, group accounts, and passwords, as well as revisit the NDA and end-of-business agreement
</br></br></br>
* Data Retention Policies: How long the data collected on a group or company will be stored before deleted (organize, maintain, archive, dispose)
  * Data Retention Benefits: Reduces discovery costs, reduces exposure, lowers storage requirements
* Change Management Policy: Process for implementing changes on a system.
* Change Control Policy: Process for implementing changes with software on a system
* Asset management policy: How hardware and software will be managed
  * covering receiving, labeling, recording, and security of all hardware
  * covering tracking licensing, managing versions, and handling upgrades for software assets
* Credential Policy: Guidelines on accessing the network or system resources
* Change Management Includes: Implementation, timeline, communication plan, test plan, rollback plans
* Asset Management Policies Include: Receiving, labeling and recording, physically securing hardware, tracking licensing, and tracking versions and upgrades.

## 13.2 Risk Management
* Tangible Asset: A physical item with value such as a computer, storage device, or document
* Intangible Asset: A resource that may be saleable despite not being physical (like intellectual property). This is more challenging to identify and evaluate.
* Risk Identification: Identifying risks to assets in the operational environment
* Risk Categories:
  *  External: Originating from outside of the company (competitors, floods, fire, theft...)
  *  Internal: Originating from inside the company (users, accidental, retaliation...)
  *  Multiparty: An impact on more than one company (SaaS database lost power for all users)
  *  Legacy Systems: Older systems are not as secure and this introduces risks
  *  Intelectual Property Theft: Trade secrets, and other sensitive information
  *  Software compliance/Licensing: Improper usage of devices can run legal risks
*  Risk Management Strategies:
  *  Avoid: Find a way to avoid the risk altogether
  *  Accept: Taking no other action because the risk is low or there is no better solution
  *  Mitigate: Implement some solution to make the risk lesser
  *  Transfer: Insurance policy or outsourcing the risk to someone else
* Inherent Risks: Original level of risk before implementing controls
* Residual Risks: Risk remaining after mitigations were implemented
* Risk Appetite: The acceptable level of risk for the organization (all risks cannot be removed so the goal is something acceptable)
* Risk Threshold: Limits the levels of acceptable risk
* Key Risk Indicators: Predictors for risks
* Risk Reporting: Communication of a risk profile, effectiveness of a risk management system, risk matrix to communicate risk to senior leaders.
</br></br></br>
* Risk Calculation: Risk Severity = Liklihood X Impact
* Quantitative Risk Assessments: Using numeric data in the risk assessment
* Qualitative Risk Assessments: Creating judgment categories for risk assessments (low, medium, high)
* Qualitative Analysis:
  * Determine Risk Value (AV)
  * Determine the Likelihood of risk occurring (1 in 100 years...)
  * Determine the damage in $ when the risk happens
  * Calculate the single loss expectancy (SLE) - the cost of one event happening
  * Calculate the Annualized Loss expectancy (ALE) - the cost per year given the frequency of the issue happening
* ALE = SLE x ARO = AV x EF x ARO
</br></br></br>
* Business Impact Analysis: The formal process to identify essential functions in a business (should have all of the below info)
* Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD): The time that a business can go down before going out of business
* Recovery Point Objective (RCO): The amount of data that can be lost during a system outage
* Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The amount of time that can be lost while a system is down
* Mean time between Fails (MTBF): Time that will elapse between device failures
* Mean time to Repair (MTTR): The average time needed to fully restore a system after failing

## 13.3 Email 
* Spam: Unwanted emails usually sent to many users
* SMTP Relay: A server that accepts and forwards main (should be disabled on your email server - Use TLS encryption to connect to the server.)
* Phishing Email: Email pretending to be a trusted organization for some sort of gain.
* Install spam filters, whitelists/blacklists, external messages, and avoid clicking links in all emails (user training)
* Email encryption types: S/MIME or PGP for email securing - user certificates/web of trust w/ signatures from CAs
