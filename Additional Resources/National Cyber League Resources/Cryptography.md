## Cryptography

“Cryptography, or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.”

The best item for this section is a site called dcode—specifically dcode’s cipher identifier.

**Step 1**: Copy the Ciphertext into the “CIPHERTEXT TO RECOGNIZE”. Sometimes the names of items or hints are given. Add those to “Clues/Keywords (if any)” otherwise leave this blank.

</p>

**Step 2**: Hit the “ANALYZE” button. Results will populate the left-hand side in order of likelihood. 

**Step 3**: Select one of these new options. This opens a new window.

**Step 4**: Paste the cyphertext into the new window and click “DECRYPT”

**Step 5**: Usually the text is a word or phrase in English. If it’s nonsense try a different cipher method or setting in that cipher type. 

**This method will solve a majority of these style challenges.**

## Steganography

“Steganography is the practice of hiding information in another message or object so that it's not obvious to someone looking at it.”

Some super complicated tools are good for giving you the answer to steganography. I’ve got a solution I’ve found which is low effort and works with many hidden-message challenges, but it doesn’t work in all instances.

**Step 1**: Locate the image in your downloads or wherever you saved it. 

**Step 2**: Right-click > Open With > Notepad (or a similar text app)

</p>

**Step 3**: This gives something like the image above. Flags start with “SKY-”. Try using ctrl-F (command-F for Mac) to find this on the page. 

**Step 4**: If you find the flag copy the answer. If you don’t see it, look for another instance of “SKY” in the document or look for other words, strings, or non-computer code. (Historically (if I remember correctly) there’s been a Python code hidden inside with all this machine code).
