      * Type 2: More in-depth than type 1, going into opinion of operational effectiveness of the controls in place
  * CSA: Cloud security framework, needs cloud certification, and uses the cloud control matrix
    * Cloud Control Matrix: developed by CSA, a guide for cloud users, works for major frameworks

  * Pulverizing: shredding or making unusable
  * Degaissing: Changing the polarity of the particles in a hard drive.
  * Delete or reformat: Makes the data unreadable but the device can be reused - less secure
  * Overwrite: The process of writing over data with 0s and 1s.
  * Wipe: When storage is reused - not recommended
