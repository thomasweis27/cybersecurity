# Domain 5 Task 1
## Phase 1-Plan and Prepare Assessment:
### 6 steps for Phase 1:
##### Recieve CMMC Assessment Request from the OSC:
* The OSC initiates the process, contacting a C3PAO
* C3PAO will confirm the logistics of the assessment
* C3PAO will get a general sense of the readiness of the OSC.
##### Establish Roles and Responsibilities
* C3PAO works with the OSC Assessment Offical and OSC Point of Contact
* C3PAO identifies the Lead Assessor, ATMs, and CMMC Quality Assurance Professional (CQAP) for the assessment
##### Organize and Prepare Assessment Documents and Templates
* The C3PAO will need to track and keep consistent several assessment items
* C3PAOs must use CMMC-AB templates during the assessments
* Templates can change and ATMs must use the correct template
##### Analise the Assessment Requirements
* "Framing the Assessment" e.g., size, scale, date, time, places, manner, resources, and effort associated with CMMC assessment
##### Develop the Assessment Plan
* Document critical deliverables for the CMMC Assessment Process
* Record of everything associated with conducting the assessment; e.g., requirements, agreements, logistics, team composition, schedules, etc.
* Plan must always be up-to-date
* Plan is the final Phase 1 Deliverable
* This final plan must be uploaded to eMASS
* Must include:
  * evidence collection approch
  * assessment team selections
  * Determination of OSC resources
  * Facilities
  * cost
  * Schedule
  * mode (i.e., in-person, hybrid, virtual)
  * any conflict of interests & conflict resolution
##### Verify Readiness to Conduct the Assessment
* The Lead Assessor will confirm that the users are ready to perform the assessment
* OSC will identify, obtain, verify, and inventory evidence that exists
* Identify potential issues, gaps, and risks
* Finally conduct a Certification Assessment Readiness Review (CARR), verifying:
  * evidence readiness
  * Assessment team readiness
  * logistical readiness
  * assessment risk status
  * Overall feasibility
### Validation criteria for OSC's assessment evidence
* The method and mode must be documented for assessment evidence.
* Documentation types can be different depending on the location assessed, including:
  * documentation
  * Screenshots
  * Interview notes
  * system artifacts
  * physical inspection
* Evidence Collection is to be done virtually
### Analyze CMMC Practice Requirements
* Per CAP, Assessors should use CMMC Assessment Guide Level 2, Version 2.0
* Validation uses the following scoring:
  * Met - the practice is met, and this contains statements as to why and the corresponding evidence. 
  * Not Met - The practice is not met, and there is documentation as to why the controls are not enough.
  * Not Applicable - The practice is marked N/A and a reason for N/A is documented. 
* Validation of the self-assessment should be done for framing and accuracy. 
### CMMC Assessment Plan
* The plan is iterative through Phase one
* The plan is submitted to CMMC eMASS following phase one
* The plan must be validated by the OSC assessment official, Lead Assessor, and C3PAO
* The plan has updates added for changes, including but not limited to:
  * Scope changes
  * OSC organization's scope and function changes
  * date/time changes for scheduled events
  * Any disruptions before Phase 1 or during Phase 2.
### CMMC Readiness Review Process
* Before Phase 2 the readiness to conduct assessment must be verified. This includes:]
  * prep of the assessment team
  * ID of obtaining, verifying, and inventorying evidence
  * Perform a Certification Assessment Readiness Review (CA-RR)
  * identify risks
  * Update the plan
  * Upload the Pre-Assessment Template Package to the CMMC eMASS
