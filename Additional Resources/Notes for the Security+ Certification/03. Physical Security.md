## Physical Security
### 3.1 Physical Threats:
* Barriers: Prevent the entry into a specific location. Can direct/stop the flow of traffic.
  * Fences: Tall walls to keep people out.
  * Barricades: Items that can be fixed or movable to prevent someone from accessing a specific location. 
  * Bollards: Retractable poles that prevent a vehicle from going in a specific location.
* Signs: Something notifying the user they are in a secure area to deter them from unwanted actions. 
* Guard Dogs: Expensive but effective way of keeping unwanted visitors away.
* Proper Lighting: If something is well-lit, it is harder to do something unseen.
* Security guards can monitor the full location and secure a facility but can also be costly and need training.
* Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV): A camera can help with monitoring and can be used for investigations later on.
  * Bullet camera: Long and round with a build-in lens - indoor or outdoor options
  * Dome Camera: Camera with a plastic or glass dome.
  * Pan tilt zoom camera: Allows movement and manipulation of the camera as needed.
* Man Trap: Location between two doors where an unwanted person can be detained/trapped if needed.
* Turnstyle: Make sure only people with authentication can access the area behind the turnstyle. Similar to a mantrap.
* Door Locks: Only allow people with proper access to enter an area.
  * Pick-resistant locks to prevent access.
  * Keypad locks to know a combination instead of having a key/pickable lock.
  * Smart cards to badge into a specific location. Short-range option.
  * Proximity cards to allow entry within a specific location. Medium range option.
  * Biometric lock: use iris or fingerprint scans to ensure the user is validated before entry.
* Physical Access Logs: Make sure that users sign in with the time and reason for entry saved.
* Defense in Depth: Adding up several different types of security to make something more secure with all the layers helping to prevent security issues.

### 3.2 Device and Network Protection
* Locked Network Closet: Networking devices are locked away in a networking closet to make sure that only authorized people are allowed in the networking room.
* Vault: In addition to being locked in a room, networking devices or other devices can be locked up to prevent them from being stolen.
* Faraday cage: Cages that block electronic emissions from eavesdropping. Collecting electronic emissions is known as Van Eck phreaking.
* Protected Cable Distribution: Networking cables are kept secure and not in a way that could be easily tapped into between the networking device and computer.
* Malicious USB (Universal Serial Bus): USB chords are not always secure and could be part of a keylogger or some other way of gaining data.
* Malicious flash drive: Flash drives that are found can hold viruses or other dangerous elements and should not be put into a computer.
* Card cloning: The process of making a copy of a card. Cards can be copied if lost or misplaced, allowing unwanted access to an organization.
* Skimming: Scanning the credentials of a card when in use and storing these to be used later. Works with proximity cards.
* Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) or Screened Subnet: Provide security by letting the publically accessible part of the network be separated from the rest of the network. Then firewalls go before and after the DMZ.
* Air gap: A method that isolates a network from the internet to prevent infection from the internet. Can only be accessed on-site/in-person.
