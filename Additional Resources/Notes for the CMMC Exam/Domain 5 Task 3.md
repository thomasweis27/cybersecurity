# Domain 5 Task 3
## Phase 3 - Report Assessment Results
### Evidence Provided
* Reporting recommended assessment results happens in Phase 3, after the assessment evidence is gathered and analyzed.
* Daily briefings and preliminary findings in Phase 2 aim to ensure no surprises for the OSC and give them every chance to succeed.
* The Lead Assessor may handle reporting or involve Assessment Team members, including CCPs, to compile and present findings.
* Final findings are presented to the OSC using the CMMC Findings Briefing and a detailed workbook or spreadsheet of results.
* Findings can be shared during the final daily checkpoint or in a separate findings and recommendations review.
* The Lead Assessor packages, baselines, and retains all assessment documentation and artifacts.
* Documentation undergoes quality review by the CQAP to ensure completeness and accuracy.
* Assessment results, formatted per CMMC Data Standards, are uploaded to CMMC eMASS by authorized C3PAO staff.
### Scoring, Validating, and Delivering Preliminary Results
* The Lead Assessor and Assessment Team review evidence for practices in the Limited Practice Deficiency Correction Program.  
* If evidence shows all deficiencies are corrected, the practice score changes to "MET." If deficiencies remain, the score stays "NOT MET."  
* For unresolved deficiencies, the Lead Assessor may recommend moving them to a POA&M if the assessment score is â‰¥ 80% (88/110 practices "MET").  
* OSCs with a POA&M are eligible for the POA&M Close-Out Assessment option and maintain their original interim certification start date.  
* If the POA&M Close-Out Assessment is not viable, the Lead Assessor will recommend the OSC not receive CMMC L2 Certification.  
* OSCs that fail certification must correct deficiencies and reapply for CMMC L2 Certification.  
* CCPs play a key role in evidence review and must thoroughly understand scoring and its impact on overall results.
