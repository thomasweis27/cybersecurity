# Devices and Infrastructure
## 5.1 Security Appliances

* Proxy Servers: Accepts and forwards requests, can filter or modify traffic/cache data, and restrict IP address restrictions
  * Forward Proxies: Accept requests from client servers and forward them to servers
  * Reverse Proxies: Placed between servers and clients and help load balancing and cache contents.
  * Transparent Proxies: Between user and internet, used for redirecting requests without changing the request and can be used for web filters.
* Content/URL Filters: Devices/software that allow or block network traffic based on rules.
  * Simple Rules: URLs, Domains, categories, or hosts
  * Complex rules: Pattern matching, IP reputation, other advanced features
  * Allow/Deny Lists: Can have rules on content for specific users and can be a list of firewalls or other appliances.
* Network Access Controls: Determines if a device should be able to connect to a network.
  * Agent-Based: Software on a device to perform security checks
  * Agentless: One that runs on a browser or somewhere where installation is not needed (IoT devices)
  * 802.1x: NAC security standard
* All-in-one Appliance: Contain antimalware, filtering, VPN, DLP, security monitoring, and logging
* Unified Threat Management (UTM): A group of features combined into one device working at one device within a network.
* New Generation Firewall (NGFW): Firewalls that include many scanning capabilities, similar to an All-In-One Appliance
* Application-Aware Devices: Devices that manage network traffic based on protocol from Application layers
* Quality of Service (QoS): Can prioritize specific things to ensure the main purpose is always met.
  * QoS Protcols: 802.11E and 802.1Q
* Security Zones/Network Segmentation: Parts of the network have specific  security requirements and are separated by routers, VLANs, and firewalls.
* East-West: Lateral movement within a zone (servers, web servers, or application servers)
* Zero-Trust: All elements in a zone and network are segmented and need validation. No assumptions on zones, but with valid users, devices, and application identities.
* Intranet: Internal networks to provide info to employees and other members and are usually protected from outside access.
* Extranet: Network for external connections by partners or customers
* Internet: Network that includes publicly available servers
* Security Zoness:
  * Wireless: Zone for wireless users to access the internet
  * Demilitarized Zone (DMZ): Network zone that is exposed to least trusted areas like the internet - Good for web servers and other Internet-facing devices & configured with firewalls
  * Guest: A guest network should be separate from other networks and regulate access.
  * Honeynet: A network designed to catch potential hackers (entrapment is illegal so this is designed to monitor and prevent issues)
  * Ad Hoc: Decentralized network that allowed connections without a base station or router. (Computer direct to computer)
* Network address translation (NAT): Takes private address and converts it to 1+ public IP addresses (expensive)
* NAT Gateway: Device that protects the gateway and chooses who/what can enter.
* Honeypot: Systems that appear vulnerable but contain many monitoring systems
* Honeynets: Networks set up to collect information about network attacks (a group of honey pots)
* HoneyFile: An attractive file, containing detectable and unique data left in an area likely to be accessed.
* Fake Telemetry: Providing fake telemetry data to mislead attackers and allow access detection.
* DNS Sinkholes: DNS server configurations to give incorrect answers to DNS queries and allow users to access harmless/traceable data




## 5.2 DMZ/Screened Subnet
* Demilitarized Zone (DMZ): A buffer network between private and unsecured networks (like the Internet).
* Bastion/Sacrificial Host: A device exposed to an attack and has been hardened to attacks.
* Screening Router: Router closest to the internet from the internal network.
* Dual-homed gateway: A firewall device, typically with three network interfaces: Internet connecting, public subnet connecting, and private subnet connecting.
* Screened Host Gateway: A device in the DMZ requiring users to authenticate to access DMZ resources.
* Screened Subnet: A subnet protected with two firewalls --> internet - external firewall - internal firewall - private network
  * Screened Subnet Typical Contents: Web, mail, and FTP servers




## 5.3 Firewalls
* Firewalls: Contol and monitor access by blocking services except those allowed by admin. (Rules can be general or specific).
* Firewall typical features: 
  * Packet filtering: The firewall analyses each network packet going in/out of the network. Filters dangerous/damaged packets and spoofed IP addresses based on admin rules.
  * Stateful Inspection: Ensures the firewall maintains a record of the connections as they pass through and monitors the state from beginning to end of the connection.
    * Analyzes the state of the entire connection
    * Known as a circuit-level proxy/gateway.
  * Stateless Inspection: Does not maintain a recode ad and uses an access control list (ACL) to allow/deny traffic.
  * Access Control Lists: List that includes packet origin, destination, protocol, TCP/IP port, and if allowed or denied.
    * Firewalls can detect changes in service connections and changes to the usual connection modes.
  * Network Access Translation (NAT): Maps the IP address source of outbound connections to the firewall's address. (Hides network in one single IP address).
  * Software: Host-based, installed on the host, protects one device.
  * Hardware: Appliance or network-based,  dedicated devices, that protect all parts of the network.
  * Virtual: Bridge mode or hypervisor mode, good for monitoring virtual environments.
  * Open-source or proprietary
  * Web Application Firewalls (WAF): monitor HTTP traffic for web attacks (XSS, SQL injections, and XSRF/CSRF)
  * Content Filtering: Filter outbound content for DLP and compliance.
  * URL Filtering: Filters specific URLs
  * UTM: All-in-one firewalls, IDS load balancer, DLP Spam, malware filter...
  * Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFW): Traditional featured plus NIDS/NIPS, app awareness, and threat intelligence
  * Config settings: Well-planed, change default settings, don't be too restrictive/lenient, and adjust settings as needed.
