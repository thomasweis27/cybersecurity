## Open Source Intelligence

"Open source intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of collecting and analyzing publicly available data to produce actionable intelligence."

**Note**: A lot of these challenges are relatively easy. Most answers are easy to find either by Google or another website listed in the challenge title. The actual challenges are harder to find and will take longer to solve.

**Step 1**: Take the question and try to find the answer on Google. Some of the "Easy" challenges have the solution highlighted on a simple Google Search. 

**Step 2**: Some other challenges are harder and need another site. Try using the title of the challenge (e.g., WHOIS) to find the site to use (e.g., https://www.whois.com/whois/)

**Step 3**: Try looking up information in questions to be able to get the resources. ```What is the Top-Level Domain (TLD) of this domain?``` is not something that's answered in ```whois```, however Googling ```What is a Top-Level Domain``` should get you to the answer pretty quick. 

**Step 4**: Something like ```Who is the issuer for Cyber Skyline's SSL certificate?``` might need some extra work. First Google what a SSL certificate is if you don't know. Then how to find it. In Chrome, click ```[the settings image next to the URL]>Connection is Secure>Certificate is valid```.

**Note**: I find this to be one of the easier challenges. Common sense and Google go a long way to get a lot of points without losing much Accuracy.
