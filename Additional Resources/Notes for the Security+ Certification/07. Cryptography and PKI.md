# Cryptography and PKI
## 7.1 Cryptography
## 7.3 Hashing
* cryptography: The practice and study of hiding information
* Cryptanalysis: Analysing and finding some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme
* Encryption: Taking data and turning it into an unreadable form (Plaintext -> Cyphertext)
* Cryptology: Cryptography and cryptanalysis
* Plaintext: The readable form of data before encryption
* Ciphertext: Data after encrypted (not readable)
* Decryption: Method of turning ciphertext into plaintext
* Encryption Cipher/Algorithm: Rules/procedures to encrypt or decrypt data
* Key/Cryptovariable: A value used tint encryption
* Historical Encryption Usages:
  * Substitution: changing one character for another
  * Ceaser cipher: Shifting all letters to a specific number of spaces.
  * ROT-13: Rotates letters 13 spaces
  * Vigenere Table: shifting letters a specific amount based on the letters of a key.
* Provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and/or non-repudiation 


## 7.2 Implementations
* Confidentiality: Ensuring data is made available to authorized people only.
* Integrity: The protection from information being altered in some way.
* Hashing: often used to create signatures for files showing if it's been edited.
* Authentication: Validating the user is who they claim to be. Done through electronic signatures or other forms of ID
* Non-repudiation: the ability to prove the origin of a signature or document (un-deniable)
* Obfuscation: Security through obscurity, making the data unreadable to a human or program. (Ex. XXX-XXX-XXX-1234 credit card number)
