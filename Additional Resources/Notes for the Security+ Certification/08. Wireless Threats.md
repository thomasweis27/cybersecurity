# Wireless Threats
## 8.1 Wireless Overview
* Wireless Networks: Easy to set up and low cost, these are subject to the same risks of cabled networks in addition to some form of eavesdropping, DoS, and intrusion.
* 801.11 is the IEEE standard for wireless communications
  * 801.11a: WiFi 2 - 54 Mbps - 5 GHz
  * 801.11b: WiFi 1 - 11 Mbps - 2.4 GHz
  * 801.11g: WiFi 3 - 54 Mbps - 2.4 GHz
  * 801.11n: WiFi 4 - 200+ Mbps - 2.4 or 5 GHz
  * 801.11ac: WiFi 5 - 1 Gbps - 5 GHz
  * 801.11ax: WiFi 6/WiFi 6E - 9.5 Gbps - 1-5/1-6 GHz
* Channels: Subdivisions of wireless frequencies (US: 11 channels, Europe: 13 channels, Japan: 14 channels)
  * Channels too close interfere with one another and channels should be as far as possible (11-1-11-1)
  * 5 GHz was designed to avoid the overlap
  * 5 GHz preferred for external networks, 2.4 GHz preferred for internal
  * Most mesh networks use 5 GHz
  * 6 GHz supports 7 160 MHz channels but is more restricted by obstacles
* Wireless Access Point (WAP): Broadcasts information over radio waves, functioning as a wireless hub
* Service Set IDentifier (SSID): Associates a name with a wireless network
* WAP Types: Fat & Thin
  * FAT: Standalone device that has everything needed to manage clients and broadcast network
  * Thin: Broadcast the network with another system to manage users and access
* Wireless Hardware:
  * Wireless interface: A device that connects to a wireless access point
  * Wireless bridge: Connecting to wireless networks together - can be implemented with a double wired connection between WAPs or a Wireless Distribution System (WDS)
  * Wireless LAN Controller (WLC): Used in an enterprise environment to manage WAPs, clients, and loads from the networking closet.
  * Lightweight Wireless Access Point (LWAP): Used with a wireless controller, contains little technology and relies on WLC for functionality and deciding to drop/forward
