# Virtualization, Cloud Security, and Securing Mobile Devices
## 9.1 Host Virtualization
* The cloud: storage that is external to a company's personal data center for storage or automation
* Access Controls: Policies about who can access the data, ensures the third party ensures data security and data is secure enough in multiple locations.
* Virtualization Benefits: Automation and self-service, reduced time to market, increased speed to develop and deliver.
* 'X' as a Service (XaaS): Some item as a service - the service being something that is in the cloud for customers
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Allows for the use of infrastructure in the cloud to host platforms and meet scaling needs.
  * IaaS also leverages automation and self-service, letting the customer to select hardware and software configurations and and provision their own infrastructure.
  * IAAS: You manage the OS and up
* Platform as a Service (PaaS): Environment comprised of computational resources (like test/dev environments) and can be easily configured.
  * Test environments easily created, multi-tenant, virtualize IP addresses, load balancers, VLANs, and can just install and test software.
  * PaaS: You manage the Data and Up
* Software as a Service (SaaS): Applications that are provided online on-demand. No set-up installation or configuration is required. (Office 365, Google Drive)
  * SaaS: You manage nothing
</br></br></br>
* Cloud Types:
  * Public: Cloud resources accessible to any customers in a multitenant model
  * Private: Cloud infrastructure accessible to a single customer
  * Community: Resources shared between organizations with common goals
  * Hybrid: A combination of cloud types and on-prem solutions
</br></br></br>
* Managed Service Provider (MSP): Delivers services on-premises at customer sites, data centers, or in third-party data centers.
  * This would be the IT department/equivalent
* Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP): Monitoring and managing security devices and systems 24x7
  * Firewalls, intrusion detections, VPNs, Vulnerability Scans, Anti-Virus, Anti-Malware, ransomware protection, and more
* On-Prem: The Company owns the infrastructure, has more control, is expensive to set up and run, and continual upgrades on infrastructure.
* Off-Prem: Don't own equipment, less control, patching and service by the provider, expenses for operating/usage.
* Fog-Computing: Extends cloud computing to the network's edge to process data where it is created (Edge Devices <-> Fog Nodes <-> Cloud Data Centers)
* Edge computing puts resources close to where data is created (a subset of fog computing)

## 9.2 Virtual Networking
* Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): Provides centralized hosting and management of desktop images
* VDI Benefits: Manage all desktops from a central location, easy to patch and manage vulnerabilities, and maintain consistency.
* Application Streaming: Applications are packaged and steamed by hosts, and each application has its own environment.
* Terminal Services: Applications are run on the server and only displayed by the host.
* Virtualization: Taking workstations, servers, storage, and networking and relocating physical devices to the cloud.
* Virtualization Benefits: Reduced expenses, minimal downtime, rapid provisioning, snapshots rollback, easy to move or copy VMs, simpler, less costly to own and operate.
* Hypervisor: A thin layer of software that resides between the guest operating system and hardware. Creates and runs VMs.
  * Type I: Runs on the bare metal server and guests run on the host (Machine -> VMs)
  * Type II: Runs on top of the OS (Machine -> Device OS -> VMs)
* Container-Based Virtualization: Lightweight OS Virtualization, containers can start up fast, share OS Kernels, and contain apps and binaries.
* Microservices: Threats each function of an application as an independent service that can be altered, updated, or taken down without the rest of the application.
  * Services are all independent and can be deployed independently.
  * Applications are broken apart by function
  * Each component is loosely coupled: a change in one should not affect others
  * Deployed via containers: Each microservice has its own container.
  * Quickly Scales: Scaling done based on the number of container instances.
* Infrastructure As Code (IAC): Allows creating repeatable processes for deploying infrastructure.
  * Replaces static scripts; has collaboration and automation tools; reduces shadow IT, more secure and less prone to vulnerabilities.
* Software Defined Networking (SDN): Decouples the management plane from the data plane.
  * Places intelligence higher in the stack.
  * Wholistic view of network and programmatic tuning based on activity, workloads, and more
  * Routers/switches become 'dumb devices' with intelligence handled by a centralized controller.
* Software Defined Visibility (SDV): Proactively responds to events and adjusts traffic, shuts down ports, logs, alerts, captures traffic, decrypts and inspects SSL,...
* Serverless Architecture: Infrastructure abstracted from the user (IaaS and PaaS) - Only the code is managed/deployed and can scale at the individual call level
  * Payment for the time that the function is called, not for the application to always be on.
* Servies Integration: Many cloud providers provide services like databases, networks, AI/ML, serverless, and more
* Resource Policies: Managed on-prem/in-cloud and enabled dynamic resource deployment, monitoring, management, and asset reclamation.
* Segmentation: Allows users to put different devices with different levels of security on different subnets. 
* Virtual Private Cloud: Can designate security levels and group subnets virtually as public or private.
* VPC Endpoints all connection of VPCs to each other using the provider's secure network.
* Transit Gateway: Connects VPCs (virtual private clouds) and how traffic is routed. 
* Secure Web Gateways: monitor web requests from internal users and evaluate them against the orgs' private policy. Good for blocking malicious activity. 
* Hardware Security <odiles (HCMs): Special purpose devices that manage encryption keys and perform cryptographic operations.
* VM Sprawl: Large number of VMs on a network without proper IT management. Usually because not destroyed when done with use. 
* VM Sprawl Avoidance:
  * Define VM Policy: Strict IT policy around VM use and creation
  * Create VM Templates: Standardized templates can use proper naming conventions and identify VM owners.
  * Implementation of Lifecycle Management: Ensure short-lived resources are reclaimed on time to ensure VMs are not forgotten.
  * Routinely Audit: Make sure that the policies that are created are enforced.
* VM Escape: A type of attack where a user breaks into a VM and then breaks out into surrounding resources, host OS, or other VMs
* Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB): Security Policy Enforcement - Authentication, single sign-on, credential mapping, device profiling, logging.
  * On-prem or in the cloud, and placed between the consumer and the cloud provider.
* Security as a Service (SECaaS): providers that offer security solutions more effectively than on-prem solutions
  * Includes authentication, anti-virus, anti-malware, intrusion detection, pen testing, SIEM, whatever the user wants to pay for.
