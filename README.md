Here is a collection of cybersecurity projects and classes I have taken at Wittenberg University. I have my resume, a few fetured labs, and some additional labs and corsework avaliable. Also, feel free to explore my "Teaching" repositories where I store corsework from some of the 375+ private lessons I've taught in primarily programming concepts. 

Thanks for visiting!
