# Domain 3 Task 2
## Roles, Responsibilities, and Authority of FCI and CUI
### Importance of Classification, Collection, and Analysis
* Cyber costs the U.S. $57-109 billion annually
* To protect sensitive data, data needs to be sorted for future use, compliance must be ensured, and data must be identified and located.
* To protect CUI NARA created the CUI registery.
  * This tracts the data put into different categories '
* DoD Instruction 5200.48 CUI: implementation of CUI program and guidance on the registry. 
##### Basic Vs. Specified CUI
* Title 32, Subtitle B, Part 2002: Provides specifics on the types of CUI (Basic vs Specified)
* Basic: All CUI is basic unless the CUI registry labels CUI as Specified.
* Specified: in addition to basic CUI, standards on limited dissemination controls from the CUI registry may be required for the Specified Authority

### Contractor Sensitive Data Categories: 
##### FCI:
* Based on the FAR: Required components to work with the Executive Branch.
* 4.1901 of the FAR defines FCI
* FCI: Info not for public release created by/for the government.
* This doesn't apply to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items available to non-DoD individuals/companies 
##### CUI:
* Managed by NARA, standardizes Executive Branch Agencies handling Unclassified info and dissemination controls. 
* Part 2002 of Title 23 CFR, 2002.4(h)
* Safeguarding/Dissemination:
  * Company must control & protect info w/out specific controls: CUI Basic
  * Company must control & protect info w/ specific controls: CUI Specific
  * Company must control & protect info w/ some specific controls but not for everything: CUI Specific for specified items, otherwise CUI basic for other CUI items. 
* CUI doesn't require info to be created for the gov to be CUI (e.g., new weapons being tested but contracted/requested for the gov. would still have CUI data)
* NARA specifies 20 categories of CUI - intended to be dynamic and allow for new addition types to be added to the list/subcategories
  * Critical Infastructure
  * Defence
  * Export Control
  * Financial
  * Immigration
  * Intelligence
  * International Agreements
  * Law Enforcement
  * Legal
  * Natural and Cultural Resources
  * NATO
  * Nucular
  * Patent
  * Privacy
  * Procedures and Acquisition
  * Proprietary Business Information
  * Provisional Statistical
  * Tax
  * Transportation

### Government Authority for identifying and Marking CUI
* After 9/11 there created the A-Hoc creation of agency-specific policies and restrictions for CUI data.
* Inconsistency is what caused the need for CUI standardization
##### Executive Order 13556
* EO 13556 CUI implemented a governing body for CUI control
* NARA was appointed for CUI oversite
##### 32 CFR Part 2002 (Implementing Directive)
* EO 13556 was implemented through 32 CFR Part 2002
* Designates NARA as the governing body and 
##### DoD instruction 5200.48: CUI
* DoDI 5200.48 establishes policy, assigns responsibility, and prescribes procedures for CUI throughout the DoD
  * This is in accordance with EO 13556, 32 CFR 2002, DFARS Sections 252.204-7008 and 252.204-7012
* DoD 5200.48 states CUI requirements include:
  * "CUI" in the header and footer of the documents
  * If some items are unclassified the whole doc is labeled "CUI" with parts labeled "U" for unclassified
  * For classified doc with CUI, the CUI will be marked in the paragraph (not header or footer, the paragraph)
  * "NOFORN"/"NF" means not releasable to foreign nationals.
  * All docs (including legacy docs) are to be reviewed for CUI and labeled
  * CUI must contain the labels:
    * Controlled By: [Name of DoD component]
    * Controlled by: [Name of office]
    * CUI Category: [May be more than one type]
    * Distribution/Dissemination Control:
    * Point of Contact
  * There is not a required distinction between the Basic and Specific CUI unless a new rule/reg/policy is issued. 

### Contractor and Authorised Parties for Handling CUI
* Per 32 CFR Part 2002 the contractor/authed user must protect the CUI:
  * Establish and use controlled environments for CUI
  * Reasonable ensure unauthed individuals cannot access, see, or hear CUI
  * Keep it under the Authed User's direct control OR maintain one physical barrier preventing access to the item.
  * Protect Confidentiality that authed users process, store, or transit.
##### DoDI 5200.48 Directives
* Per DoDI 5230.09 and the 8/14/2014 Deputy Secretary of Defence Memo:
  * CUI holder must ensure prepublication and security policy review is conducted before ready for public release
  * Decontrolling/releasing CUI will be done by the originator of the info
* OSAs will determine if CUI under their controls should be classified following Vol 1 of DoDM 5200.01
* DoD info processing, storing, or transmitting CUI will be categorized at the “moderate” confidentiality impact level and follow the guidance in DoDIs 8500.01 and 8510.01.
* Non-DoD information systems processing, storing, or transmitting CUI will provide adequate security in accordance with DoDI 8582.01.
* The DoD CUI Registry provides a list of the Indexes/Categories used to identify CUI.
* The DoD CUI Registry mirrors the National CUI Registry but provides extra info on the relationships to the DoD by "aligning each Index and Category to DoD issuances."
##### Part 2002 of Title 32 CFR
* Protects CUI under the control of an authed user.
* Authed users must:
  * Establish controlled environments for CUI protection
  * Ensure unauthed users cannot access/see/hear CUI
  * Keep it under their direct control or one physical barrier at all times
  * Protect confidentiality of the CUI

## Additional Notes from the In-Person Class

Importance of Data Classification, Collection, and Analysis
CUI Basic vs Specified: Section 2002.14 Safeguarding.
* (b) CUI safeguarding standards. Authorized holders must safeguard CUI using one of the following types of standards:
  * (I) CUI Basic. CUI Basic is the default set of standards authorized holders must apply to all CUI unless the CUI Registry annotates that CUI as CUI Specified.
  * (2) CUI Specified.
    * (i) Authorized holders safeguard CUI, as specified per the requirements of the underlying authorities indicated in the CUI Registry.
    * (ii) When the laws, regulations, or Government-wide policies governing a specific type of CUI Specified are silent on either safeguarding or disseminating control, agencies must apply CUI Basic standards to that aspect of the information's controls, unless this results in treatment that does not accord with the CUI Specified authority. In such cases, agencies must apply the CUI Specified standards and may apply limited dissemination controls listed in the CUI Registry to ensure they treat the information in accordance with the CUI Specified authority.
