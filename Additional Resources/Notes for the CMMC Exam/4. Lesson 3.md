# CMMC Governance and Source Documents
CMMC Governance and Source Documents are based on:
* Federal Acquisition Regulations
* Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
* National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
* Department of Defense (DoD) Instructions
* Department of Defense (DoD) Memorandum
* National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
* CERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM)

FCI vs CUI:
* FCI: The US Department of Defense (DoD) has a vested interest in ensuring the confidentiality of Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
* CUI: The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Framework is designed to improve the security posture of Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants and hold DIB participants accountable for the protection of FCI and CUI and process, store, or transmit CUI.
  * CUI extends the requirements of FCI

 CMMC v2.O Program Requirements
 * Streamlines Model:
   * Three levels
   * Removed Delta controls [removed because of DoD overeach]
   * Alligned with NIST SP 800-171, 800-171A, 800-172, and 800-172A standards
* Reliable Assessments:
  * Reduced Assessment Cost: Allows all companies at Level 1 (Foundational), and a subset of companies at Level 2 (Advanced) to demonstrate compliance through self-assessments
  * Highter Accountability: Increases oversight of professional and ethical standards of third-party assessors
* Flexible Implementation
  * Spirit of collaboration - DoD collaboration with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) to improve cybersecurity
  * Added flexibility and speed - CMMC 2.0 allows
  * Level 1 (FCI only) organizations "self-attest"
    * Assessment (all I IO practices) per the NIST DoD Assessment Methodology
    * Enter score into the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS)
  * Level 2 (CUI and FCI) organizations may
    * Configure network to logically or physically separate scope for FCI only and for FCI and CUI
    * C3PAO confirms that OSC conducted self assessment for FCI scope
    * C3PAO verifies all 110 practices (FCI and CUI) within scope for the Level 2 assessment

Rulemaking and Timeline for CMMC v2.O
* When will CMMC 2.0 be required for DoD contracts?
  * CMMC 2.0 will not be a contractual requirement until the DoD completes rulemaking to implement the program
  * The rulemaking process and timelines typically take 9-24 months
  * The Proposed Rule was published 12/26/2023
    * The public comment period lasts for 60 days
  * The Final Rule typically takes 280 days to complete once the proposed rule is published (i.e., first half of 2025)
  * CMMC 2.0 will become a contract requirement when DoD completes rulemaking and updates related assessment guides
    * Contact certification requirements will be in clause 252-202.7021
   
CMMC Assessment Levels and Requirements
* Level I - Foundational (same as previous CMMC vl .O level I)
* Level 2 - Advanced (same as previous CMMC VI .0 levels 2 and 3)
* Level 3- Expert (same as previous CMMC vl .0 levels 4 and 5)

Documentation:
* Understand the context - go to the discussion to understand
* Read the discussion
* Discover the trigger word
* Draft the implementation - don't wordsmith - use the exact words in the request
  * Make sure to address the specific things in the NIST "Discussion"
    * e.g., Mobile device = phones, ereaders, SOMETIMES laptops, things that work disconnected with a power source - not just a phone.
    * Make sure to look at the specific word in the assessment objective. 
</br>

* Bob's Machine Shop defines information flow control policies [a] via layer managed switch access control lists (ACLs).
* Bob's Machine Shop defines methods and enforcement mechanisms for controlling the flow of CUI [b] via procedures and L3 Switch configurations.
* Per the implementation statements; Determine and provide the adequate and sufficient evidence.

* Disputes: SPRS - supplier performance risk system
  * Sam.gov --> DLA --> Cage Code --> used by OSE for cert
  * For aceess SPRS: PIEE --> Accounts --> RBAC



 
NIST DoD Assessment Methodology
* Determine Basic score (self-assessment)
* DIBAC - Moderate, High in Person, High Remote
* USG SSO
* SAM - System for Award Management
  * CAGE - Commercial and Government Entity Program
  * IJEI • Unique Entity Identifier
  * D&B- Dun & Bradstreet
* PIEE - Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment
  * OSC must identify the OSC's contract administrator
* SPRS - Supplier Performance Requirements System
  * this score ends up (for independent assessments only) in eMASS
* eMASS - Enterprise Mission Assurance support Service
  * eMASS is DoD database for storing security results
  * eMASS has multiple instances e.g. Army, AF, Navy, Marines, CMMC
  * C3PAO's will have an person on staff to enter L2 results
  * That person must have an eMASS acceptable identity certificate
* ECA - External Certification Authority

## When auditing:

Three approved methods:
* **Review** the documentation - see it exists,
* **Interview** to verify that the documents are used and people know about it
* **Testing** to ensure that what they say they do, they can actually do. (If we don't believe them.)

People being audited should be able to hit all the points and know how to hit all the requirements. 

OSEs need to train the staff how to respond:
* In one or two full sentences (this is like playing poker - focus on typing not the interviewee)
* The interviewee should not say something that would hurt the audit (easy if they keep talking)
* Two person process, one person asks questions, one takes notes. (switching back and fourth)
*
