Conducting an Assessment: (CAP version 5.6.1 - for the exam)

Phase 1:
	• Receive CMMC Assessment Request from S
	• Establish Roles and Responsibilities
	• Organize and Prepare Assessment Documents and Templates
	• Ascertain Assessment Conditions and Requirements
		○ Requirements are from 171A
		○ Conditions are virtual, in person, or hybrid. 
			§ Dave says that most are hybrid currently. 
			§ This version of the CAP says that at least some part of this would be in person (out of date).
	• Frame the Assessment
		○ How is the assessment going to be performed? 
			§ Need to collect information to answer if the organization is ready (before the assessment even starts)
	• Identify Lead Assessor
		○ Done internally as a C3PAO
	• Confirm the Corporate Identity to be Assessed
		○ Get the organizations name, who is assessed, the scope, and the CAGE code. 
		○ Can be done virtual or in person, must be done before the assessment. 
	• Understanding the Corporate Identity to be Assessed
	• Validate CMMC Assessment Scope
	• Evaluate Model Non-Duplication
	• Inventory OSC Cybersecurity Practices Against CMMC Model
		○ Basically the SSP
		○ Making sure there is an implementation statement for the controls within the SSP
	• Verify and Record Evidence Against Adequacy and Sufficiency Criteria
		○ Looking at the documents and figure out if it's (loosely) applicable
		○ Then in phase 2, will use these docs and interviews, will do the assessment and ask them to re-create the listings in real time. 
			§ E.g., creating real-time reports through AD or Intune, shows that it's real and not just and old, random, or inaccurate document. 
	• Complete Pre-Assessment Planning
	• Develop Evidence Collection Approach
	• Select Assessment Team Members
		○ Done internally from the C3PAO
	• Identify Resources and Schedule
	• Identify and Manage Conflicts of Interest (COI)
		○ Make sure that the C3PAO/C3PAO Contractors have not worked with the OSC
	• Verify Readiness to Conduct the Assessment
	• Access and Verify Evidence
		○ Determine and provide them a location to deposit evidence where both parties can access (C3PAO and OSC)
	• Make Assessment Feasibility Determination
	• Conduct Quality Review on Pre-Assessment Form Data
	• Upload Pre-Assessment Form into CMMC eMASS
		○ Upload plan, and if the plan is updated, then the plan needs to be re-uploaded. 
	• Prepare the Assessment Team
		○ Expected this to be a 4-5 person team during writing this. 
		○ Currently minimum people are 2 CCA (one being a Lead CCA)
		○ Usually assessments are more likely to have 2 people. 
	• Execute the C3PAO-OSC Contractual Agreement

Additional Phase 1 Information:
	• Make sure to get all cage codes. 
		○ For all sections of the company there should be a cage code, plus the HQ of the organization (if there's an upper governing body. )
		○ If there's a a JV, each governing body needs a CAGE code. 
		○ CAGE codes can be made on sam.gov
		○ If multiple sections of the business wants approval, they each needs a CAGE code, plus the overarching HQ or other overarching bodies. 
		○ 
		○ Working on a process to replace CAGE codes
			§ CAGE codes are 5 characters and eventually complies run out of 5 character combinations. 
	• The OSC has the initial responsibility to establish the CMMC Assessment Scope of their networked environment, to include identifying and taking inventory of the various categories of assets contained therein that will be the subject of the CMMC Assessment
		○ The OSC provides the Lead Assessor with supporting documentation such as network schematic diagrams, a System Security Plan, policies, and organizational charts
		○ The Lead Assessor verifies the scope accuracy and integrity
	• Preliminary List of Possible Evidence
		○ Documents
			§ System Security Plan (SSP) - no SSP = no assessment 
			§ Plans
			§ Policies
			§ Procedures
			§ Security Assessment Plans
			§ Security Assessment Reports
			§ System Configurations
			§ Incident Response Plans
			§ Risk Assessment Report
		○ Inventories
			§ Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
		○ Assets
			§ Security Protection Assets
			§ Contractor Risk Managed Assets
			§ Specialized Assets
		○ Screen shares
		○ Audit logs
		○ Artifacts
		○ Physical reviews

Phase 2
	• Convene Assessment Kickoff Meeting
	• Collect and Examine Evidence
		○ This should mostly already have been provided. 
		○ Don't give more information than what's needed. 
	• Examine and Analyze Evidence
	• Conduct Interviews and Assess Responses
		○ As for questions for additional information. 
		○ There should be periods of silence where the C3PAO has time to document the answer to the questions. 
	• Observe Tests and Analyze Results
		○ There should be information from automatic tools. 
		○ Ask for additional evidence or for them to re-generate lists. 
	• Identify and Document Evidence Gaps
		○ Some gaps can be closed with more evidence provided to show the closing of the gap. 
		○ However, cannot make the changes and then re-enter fixed evidence. 
			§ Cannot fix things during the assessment. (Emphasized by the Cyber AB)
			§ There is some leeway for tiny on-the-spot corrections (e.g., typos)
			§ No evidence on what can be fixed and not. 
			§ Rerunning reports, and correcting typos are probably fine
			§ Updating user access listings or implementing MFA would likely not be fine
	• Update Evidence Review Approach and Status
	• Score OSC Practices and Validate Preliminary Results
	• Determine and Record Initial Scores
	• Correct Limited Practice Deficiencies
	• Generate and Validate Preliminary Recommended Findings
	• Determine Final Practice MET/NOT MET/NA Results
	• Create and Finalize and Record Recommended Final Findings
	• Support Assessment Appeals Process
		○ The Cyber AB has just released information on what this appeals process is supposed to look like. 
	
Additional Phase 2 Information:
	• Assessment procedures address one or more assessment objectives and potential assessment methods for each practice
	• Assessment objectives are the determination statements related to the CMMC practice
	• Determination statements are linked to assessment objectives
	• The application of assessment procedures produces assessment findings
	• Assessment findings help determine if the CMMC practice has been satisfied
	Evidence to be examined is provided during Phase I verifying the organization is prepared for
	the assessment
		○ Cannot be a draft - anything with "draft" is a fail
		○ Any document without conformation that's it's  not been approved is a fail. 
		○ Phase 1 is to check if it exists, phase 2 is to actually assess these artifacts. 
	
	
Phase 3:
	• Deliver Recommended Assessment Results
		○ Want to make sure they are aware of the findings. 
	• Deliver Final Findings
	• Submit, Package, and Archive Assessment Documentation
	• Limited Practice Deficiency Correction Evaluation
		○ Doing this assessment after submitting documentation is an issue that's been resolved in the newer version. 
	• CMMC Quality Assurance Professional (CQAP) Verifies Assessment Results Package
		○ There is not any training and testing for this roll. 
		○ There is no CQAP position or role. 
		○ This is applicable for this assessment. According to the assessment tis exists. 
	• Upload Assessment Results Package into CMMC eMASS
		○ This should be the same person that also uploaded the CAP.
	• Archive or Dispose of any Assessment Artifacts
	• Final CMMC Assessment Report Appeals Resolution
		○ No guidance on how long this should take. 
		○ There is no limit to the days or months that this can take. 
		○ Basically everything stops until this happens. 
	• Responsibility of OSC Issued CMMC L 2 Conditional Certifications

Additional Phase 3 Information:
	• With the POA&Ms the assessor can check to see if the proposed change is something that's possible. 
	• If the POA&M expires without being fixed the OSC may loose the contract. 
		○ This depends on the wording on the contract. 
		○ Wording in the contract should make them lose the contract, but it depends on the wording on the contract. 
	• Lead CCA makes sure things are wrapped up
	· C3PAO submits all the remaining documentation. 

Phase 4 (if needed):
	· Perform POA&M Close-Out Assessment
	· Update POA&M Closeout
	· Update POA&M - OSC Reapply
	· Support POA&M Close-Out Assessment Appeal Resolution
		○ Can appeal a POA&M
		○ Max of 22 controls
		○ 80% are required. = 88 controls
		○ Can have things reevaluated as many time as needed. (no defined limit)
