Here's the process for obtaining files, including the hidden files, from a Word doc. 

**Step 1**: Download the Word doc. 

**Step 2**: Open the file. Inside you will see four images. Now open the document as a ```.txt``` file. You will be able to see the names of these file names (```image1.png``` - ```image4.png```). You'll also see one more file. That's what you're looking for. The file is hidden somehow.

**Step 3**: The current file is not useful to us, we need to extract the information. Let's change it to a different file type ```.zip```. These are good for extracting data. Click the ```.docx``` file and change the ending from ```.docx``` to ```.zip```.  

**Step 4**: Unzip the file. This can be done by right-clicking and clicking ```Extract All ```.

**Step 5**: Open the file and look around. Find the files named ```image1.png``` - ```image4.png```, plus the extra file.
