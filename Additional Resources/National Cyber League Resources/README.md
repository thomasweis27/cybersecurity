Here are files I've made for the 2024 Fall National Cyber League (NCL) competition that I've worked on to help the current group of Wittenberg Cyber Graduates at the request of my professor.


NCL Challenges are broken into the following categories:
* Open Source Intelligence
* Cryptography
* Password Cracking
* Forensics
* Log Analysis
* Network Traffic Analysis
* Scanning & Reconnaissance
* Web Application Exploitation
* Wireless Access Exploitation
* Enumeration & Exploitation

This folder contains how-to steps to help begin with the NCL and a folder containing Python files that have helped me complete various challenges. The goal of this is to provide educational material on how to solve cyber challenges without giving students an answer to these challenges.
