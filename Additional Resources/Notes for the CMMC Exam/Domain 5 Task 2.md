# Domain 5 Task 2:
## Phase 2 - Conduct the Assessment
* There are three procedures in the Phase 2 part of the assessment:
  * Collect and Examine Evidence
  * Score Practices and Validate Preliminary Results
  * Generate Final Recommended Score Findings
* The process begins with a kickoff meeting containing stakeholders, ATM, Lead Assessors, and the C3PAO
* Next, the team begins examining the Assessment Objects (term defined by the CAP) supplied to the assessor.
* Participants identified in Phase 1, are interviewed if needed and results analyzed.
* ATM will observe tests/demos and assess those.
* After evidence is collected through interviews, examining, or testing, the evidence is verified and gaps recorded.
* Assessment teams may now label things as 'MET'
* The assessment team then reviews and validates their scores of in-scope practices with the OSC Host Unit during the daily review.
* Something not met needs assigned the associated score.
* The OSC can then remediate the deficiencies in a restricted timeframe in a ```Limited Practice Deficiency Correction Program```
* The C3PAO has the last interpretation authority for scores.
* If final results are less than 80% (88/110) then the certification is not achieved and OSC must reapply and fix issues
* If final results are 80% or more, the OSC has 5 business days for remediation before the final report is added to eMASS.
* POA&Ms are allowed for remediation, but only for specific controls and require remediation within 180 days.
* The lead assessor is responsible for assessing POA&M validity and assessment close-out.
### Assist/Support Assessment Team
* CCPs are to assist lead assessors with verifying evidence and recording gaps
* Lead Assessors make sure all ATMs are adequately trained in conducting the assessment.
* CCPs help ensure evidence is needed to support claims and intent/objectives of CMMC practices.
  * Adequacy: if a given artifact, response, demonstration, or test meets the CMMC Practice.
  * Suffucancy: if the ATM/Lead assessor has enough of the correct evidence
* Assessment Object identifies the specifications, mechanisms, activities, and individuals being assessed.
  * Specifications: document-based artifacts associated with a system
  * Artifact: Something that can be examined to verify assessment objects.
  * Mechanisms: Hardware, software, or firmware used in the system.
  * Activities: Protection-based actions supporting a people-involved system
  * Individuals: People or groups applying with specifications, mechanisms, or activities. 
### Assessment Methods (Examine, Interview, and Test)
* Assessment Methods include one or more of three: Examine, Interview, and Test
* Sufficiency of Evidence: Evidence must cover the full scope (hosts, supporting units, enclaves) and address assessment objectives.
* Evidence Gaps: Gaps occur when evidence is incomplete (e.g., missing signatures, or incomplete test results).
* Assessment Team Process: Gaps are documented, and practices are marked as "MET" or "NOT MET." The Lead Assessor is informed of any "NOT MET" practices.
* Role of CCP: CCP reviews evidence, consults the Lead Assessor for judgment calls, and takes detailed notes to justify decisions.
### Communication Skills for Interviewing or Observing
* Communication Skills: Assessment Team members must articulate questions clearly, record responses accurately, and provide clarifications and feedback effectively.
* Role of CCP: The CCP supports interviews and observations with a detailed understanding of CMMC practices, OSC industry, and infrastructure.
* Interview Techniques: The CCP should ask relevant questions, listen actively, and seek clarification to assess compliance.
* Protecting Anonymity: Use pseudonyms or code names to ensure interviewee confidentiality.
* Documentation: Write clear, detailed notes to support assessments and enable others to make determinations based on the evidence.
### ATM Rate Practices and Preliminary Results
* The assessment Team will score each CMMC practice based on evidence.
* For something to be ```MET```:
  * Assessment team must examine and accept: Artifact, Interview/Affirmation, or Test/demo/observation
  * Evidence must apply to the correct policy
  * Evidence accepted must be adequate
  * Practices covered by nonduplication agreements may need less evidence review, as explained in the Assessment Plan.
* If this is not true it is ```NOT MET```
* If it doesn't apply, it is ```Not Applicable```  
### ATM Assistance in Preparation of Findings
* The CCP helps the Lead Assessor with scoring and preparing the final findings.
* Practices are scored MET/NOT MET/NA, and results are reviewed during daily checkpoints.
* If a practice spans multiple areas, results are combined into a single score.
* CMMC Level-2 assessments follow DoD Scoring Methodology, with deductions for practices marked NOT MET.
* Practices eligible for POA&Ms are tracked using the CMMC Assessment Results Template.
* The C3PAO has final authority on scoring disputes.
* The ```Limited Practice Deficiency Correction Program``` allows fixing certain issues within limits but excludes critical security gaps or practices not implemented before the assessment.
* Practices allowing for different corrections are:
  * External Connections
  * Control Public Information
  * Control CUI Flow
  * Separation of Duties
  * Non-Privileged Account Use
  * Privileged Functions
  * Unsuccessful Logon Attempts
  * Privacy & Security Notices
  * Session Lock
  * Session Termination
  * Remote Access Routing
  * Privileged Remote Access
  * Portable Storage Use
  * Event Review
  * Audit Failure Alerting
  * Reduction & Reporting
  * Authoritative Time Source
  * Audit Protection
  * Audit Management
  * Insider Threat Awareness
  * System Change Management
  * Security Impact Analysis
  * User-Installed Software
  * Replay-Resistant
  * Authentication
  * Identifier Reuse
  * Identifier Handling
  * Password Complexity
  * Password Reuse
  * Temporary Passwords
  * Obscure Feedback
  * Incident Response Testing
  * Equipment Sanitization
  * Maintenance Personnel
  * Media Markings
  * Media Accountability
  * Portable Storage Encryption
  * Protect Backups
  * Escort Visitors
  * Physical Access Logs
  * Manage Physical Access
  * Alternative Work Sites
  * Vulnerability Remediation
  * System Security Plan
  * Role Separation
  * Shared Resource Control
  * Split Tunneling
  * Connections Termination
  * Key Management
  * Collaborative Device Control
  * Mobile Code
  * Voice over Internet Protocol
* Practices can qualify for limited deficiency correction if they are mostly implemented but need minor updates (e.g., policy signatures or procedural updates).
* The practice must not affect the effectiveness of other practices scored "MET."
* Limited deficiency practices are marked as "NOT MET" and tracked in a worksheet.
* Preliminary findings summarize scores and validate the Assessment Teamâ€™s understanding of practices and evidence.
* Daily checkpoints allow feedback from OSC participants, potentially adjusting scores and findings.
* Final findings and recommended scores are presented to the OSC after all evidence is reviewed and validated.
### Scoring POA&M Items
* POA&Ms allow remediation of incomplete practices within 180 days after the final assessment briefing.
* Interim Certification requires:
  * 80% of practices scored "MET" (88/110).
  * POA&M items must meet CAP Appendix K criteria.
* POA&Ms track security weaknesses and corrective actions with regular updates.
* Practices needing a POA&M are scored "NOT MET."
* Practices scored 5 points cannot be in a POA&M and must be fixed before the assessment.
* POA&Ms can include 1-point or 3-point practices, with quicker fixes optionally handled via the Deficiency Correction Program.
* The DoD Assessment Methodology starts with a maximum score of 110 points.
* Points are deducted for practices scored as NOT MET:
  * 5 points for high-risk requirements (e.g., potential exploitation or exfiltration of DoD CUI).
  * 3 points for medium-risk requirements affecting security.
  * 1 point for low-risk requirements with limited impact.
* Partial credit is not given, except for SC.L2-3.13.11 (FIPS-validated encryption).
* A System Security Plan (SSP) is required to describe contractor systems, and Plans of Action (POA&Ms) must address unimplemented practices within 180 days.
* Practices with ongoing implementation or without a POA&M are scored as NOT MET.
* CCPs can not consult, only assess in the process.
