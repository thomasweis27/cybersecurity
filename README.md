Here is my collection of cybersecurity projects and classes I have taken at Wittenberg University. I have my resume, a few featured labs, and some additional labs and coursework available. Also, feel free to explore my "Teaching" repositories where I store coursework from some of the 400+ private lessons I've taught in primarily programming concepts. 

Thanks for visiting!
