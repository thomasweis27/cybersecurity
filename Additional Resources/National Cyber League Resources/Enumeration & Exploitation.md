## Enumeration and exploitation
Enumeration and exploitation are processes in cybersecurity that help identify vulnerabilities in systems and exploit them:
* **Enumeration**: The process of gathering information about a system, such as usernames, machine names, and network resources. 
* **Exploitation**: The process of using the information gathered during enumeration to exploit vulnerabilities and gain access to confidential information.

Four of the challenges take Python and have you reverse-engineer a solution from the code. This is a lot easier than you might think. 

**Step 1**: Start with the code that is given. 
```
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

def main():
  if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Invalid args")
    return
  password = sys.argv[1]
  builder = 0
  for c in password:
    builder += ord(c)
  if builder == 1000 and len(password) == 10 and ord(password[1]) == 83:
    print("correct")
  else:
    print("incorrect")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

**Step 2**: Seem complex? We can remote information. Make it something we can execute in an IDE without the need for a command prompt. 

```
def main(password):
  builder = 0
  for c in password:
    builder += ord(c)
  if builder == 1000 and len(password) == 10 and ord(password[1]) == 83:
    print("correct")
  else:
    print("incorrect")
main(“Some Text Ender Here”)
```

**Step 3a**: Take the remaining code and further reverse-engineer a solution. Break it down into pieces and see if you can simplify the solution further. 

**Step 3b**: Start sticking print statements in and trying for answers. (This is better if you’re not the best at Python. This takes a bit more time, but not much more, and requires less mental effort.) 

**3b:**
```
def main(password):
  builder = 0
  for c in password:
    builder += ord(c)
  if builder == 1000 and len(password) == 10 and ord(password[1]) == 83:
    print("correct")
  else:
    print("incorrect")
print(builder, len(password), ord(password[1]) == 83)
main(“Some Text Ender Here”)
```

Although this is not the best system, guess and check [and some common sense], this will give you a solution in about 5-15 minutes. Just get the values of ```builder```, ```len(password)``` and ```ord(password[1]) == 83``` to get the solution.

### Non-Python Program Challenges

Not all programs are made in Python. Sometimes the challenge is figuring out what the program is and what it does. I like to take the program and convert the basic functionality to Python which is easier for me to figure out. 

```
import hashlib

# Predefined hash
target_hash = bytes([0x8f, 0xcc, 0xe5, 0x0f, 0x39, 0x2a, 0x6f, 0xab, 0x43, 0xf3, 0x0d, 0x3a, 0xf6, 0x09, 0xd4, 0xe3])
key = [47, 69, 82, 74, 80, 47, 52, 53, 58, 58]

# Find valid 3-byte prefix
for i in range(0, 256):
    for j in range(0, 256):
        for k in range(0, 256):
            input_bytes = bytes([i, j, k])
            hashed = hashlib.md5(input_bytes).digest()
            if hashed == target_hash:
                prefix = input_bytes
                break

# Calculate the flag with the known key
key_byte = target_hash[0] & 0x12
flag = bytearray(prefix)

for index in range(10):
    flag.append(key[index] ^ key_byte)

# Print the valid flag
print("The flag is:", flag.decode())

```
