## Networks and Hosts Design and Diagnosis
### 4.1 Managable Network Plan
* Managable network plan: A process created by the NSA to make a network manageable, defensible, and secure.
* Milestone: An action or event to become more secure.
1. Prepare to Document
  * Establish the process to document the network.
  * Is: easy to use, includes detail, uses timestamps, protected access with encryption, printed copy
2. Map your network
  * Create a map of the network topology
  * list all the devices on the network
  * List all the protocols that are listed (hostname, role, MAC address, IP address, Static/Dynamic operations)
  * Nmap is good for figuring out all the devices but still needs a physical walkthrough.
3. Protect the Network
  * Identify what groups have access to what information
  * Identify high-value assets (Domain controller, email server, internal web, databases)
  * Document trust boundaries
  * Establish boundaries (segregate and isolate networks)
  * Identify choke points
  * Isolate server functions - virtually or physically
  * Physically secure high-valued systems
4. Access Your Network
  * Ensure devices can be accessed by the people who need them
  * USE Windows Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
  * Ensure a secure remote access if needed
  * Automate functions as much as possible
5. Control User Access
  * People have access to what they need, but not more access than necessary.
  * Principle of least privilege, limit local admin functions, role-based access controls
  * no user-downloaded software
  * set account expiration dates, and disable or remove accounts.
6. Manage Your Network - Part I
  * Establish a patch management system for all software on the network
    * Patch regularly, critical parches first, update and patch mobile devices, automate the patching process
  * Implement a Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server
7. Manage Your Network - Part II
  * Provide rules that establish a baseline for all the systems on the network
  * Create an approved application list
  * Establish requirements for an application to become approved
  * Create and review device baselines regularly
  * Only use secure web browsers
8. Document Your Network
  * Documentation for the network, including the processes and procedures


### 4.2 Windows Hardening
* Hardening: The process of securing devices and software by reducing security exposure and tightening security controls
* Trusted Operating System: A system that comes hardened and is validated for a specific security level entry. (Defined by Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation or CC)
* Many of these operating systems support many levels of security, giving access to people on a need-to-know basis
* Password Security: Complex passwords and MFA (Something you know, have, are)
* Configuration Baseline: A set of requirements across a workstation/server.
  * Makes sure the users comply with the requirements of the network on their devices/systems.
* Security Templates: Quickly apply security baselines to given devices
* Check that all software is up-to-date and has up-to-date licenes.
* Install security software and remove unused software (reduces the surface of an attack)
* Hotfix: A quick fix for a software problem
* Patch: A fix that is much more tested to fix a security problem.
* Service Pack: A collection of patches and hotfixes that the manufacturer has tested for wide deployment.
* Manage patches: WSUS management software, Test before implementing on small groups, create system restore points.
  * Small-scale test, then deploy on a small scale, then deploy to the entire system/network
 

### 3.4 File Server Security
* Transfering data between a client and server is unsecured and vulnerable to DDoS attacks. This is against NetBIOS protocols
* Shared Folder: A folder whose contents are available across a network
  * Administrative shares are available to all admins but are hidden (applies to root users who are also admins)
  * Access the shared folders on Windows by appending a '$' (users need to know the name of the share and have appropriate access permissions)
  * Root directory should not be shared with regular users
* Big Data: Large amounts of data needed by large companies (measured in exabytes and hard to manage), usually stored in NAS or SAN devices.
* Network Attached Storage (NAS): Standalone storage device acting as a file server.
* Storage Area Network (SAN): Network of high-speed storage that is stored by many servers.
  * Best Practices: Physical security, least privilege, encryption, remove unused services, enable auditing, implicit deny ACLs
* File Transfer Protocol (FTP): Unsecure and Ports 20-21
  * Securing FTP: Use a VPN with IPsec or SSH, FTPS with SSL, and TLS on ports 989-990.
* SCP: Similar to Linux command - SSH - Secure
* SFTP - Not related to FTP - Graphical interface
* Share: Read, Contribute, Owner/Co-owner - this can only be set on a folder.
* NTFS: Drivees, folders, and files with local and network access - allow for granular control but only for volumes with NTFS
  * Share and NTFS both use Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACL)
  * Include allow/deny permissions and access configured through share. Permissions can not be higher than in a superseding file.
  * The best case is to assign permissions to groups, not users. 


### 4.4 Linux Host Security
* Remove unnecessary software: `yum list installed` or `dnf list installed` to see program packages
  * `apt autoremove` to remove unnecessary packages
  * `apt list` to list all the packages
  * `dpkg get-selections` to see installed Debian packages
* research packages to see if they are necessary
* uninstall unnecessary packages using: `yum erasepackagename`, `dnf removepackagename`, `apt removepackagename`, `rpm -epackagename`, or `dpkg -rpackagename`
* find installed services and determine what is not needed: `systemctl --type=service --state=active`
* Disable services: `systemctl disable servicename`
* stop running scripts: `systemctl stopservicename`
* remove scripts fully: `yum erasepackagename`, `dnf removepackagename`, `apt removepackagename`, `rpm -e packagename`, or `dpkg -r packagename`
* Nmap: used for scanning open ports with and disable unused ports
  * -sU: UDP scan-sT: TCP scan
  * -6: Enable IPv6 scanning
  * -A: Enable OS detection
  * -oN/-oX/-oS/-oG: Output scan in a specific file format
  * -p: only scan specified ports
  * -sn: Ping scan – disable port scan
  * -Pn: Treat all hosts as online – skip host discovery
  * -sV: Prob open ports to determine service/version info
* Netstat: used to check network connections
  * -a lists both listening and non-listening sockets
  * -l (lowercase 'L') lists listening sockets
  * -s displays statistics for each protocol
  * -i displays a table of all network interfaces
* install updates: `yum update` or `apt upgrade`
* Firewalls: Used to protect the network from unwanted data, should check for contents, protocol, origin, target
  * Firewall tools: iptables, firewalld, nftables, ufw
* Firewalld Deamon check installation: `yum info firewalld` or `apt version firewalld`
* Firewalld Deamon Install: `yum install firewalld -y` or `apt install firewalld -y`
* Firewalld Deamon Use: `systemctl status firewalld`
* Firewalld Deamon Start: `systemctl start firewall`
* IPtables - Chains: a set of rules that allow/block network traffic
  * Input: control the incoming connections
  * Forward: Control the packest leaving the system
  * Output: Used for outgoing connections
* IPtables - Actions: Choosing what to do to the connections going into/out of the network
  * Accept: allows the connection
  * Drop: Drops the connections without a response
  * Reject: Stops the connection with a response back.
* List IPtable rules: `sudo iptables -L`
* Clear IPtable rules: `sudo iptables -F`
* Block SSH connections: `iptables –A INPUT –p tcp --dport ssh –s 00.00.00.00 –j DROP`
* Allow SSH connections: `sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 22 -d 10.10.10.10 -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT`
