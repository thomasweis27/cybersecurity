# Identity, Access, and Account Management
## 6.1 Access Control Models
* Access Control: the ability to permit/deny access to a resource.
* Access control policy: Defines the measures taken to control access to an object.
* Access Control Systems: Policies, procedures, and tech to control access to the object.
* Objects: Data, apps, systems, networks, and physical assets.
* Subject: Users, applications, or processes that need to access the objects.
* 3 Items needed before access: Identification, Authentication, and Authorization
  * Identification: The user needs to identify with the correct credentials to confirm identity.
  * Authentication: Makes sure that the user is the person that they claimed to be in identification.
  * Authorization: granting permission to an object, determining if the user should be able to access the resource.
* Two-factor authentication (TFA): combining two separate single-factor authentication types.
* Multifactor authentication (MFA): Combines all three single-factor types and is the strongest option
* Single-factor authentication types:
  * Something you are
  * Something you know
  * Something you have
* Accounting/Auditing: Logging a user's activities, resources, and behaviors for analysis and monitoring.
* AAA Server (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting): RADIUS or Diameter
* Access Control Best Practices: Principle of least privilege, implicit deny, MFA, need to know, separation of duties, job rotation, account management, defense in depth.
* Access Control Classifications: Preventative, Detective, Corrective, Deterrent, Recovery, Compensative
* Access Control Restriction types: Administrative, Technical, Physical
* Access Control Schemes:
  * Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Inflexible, rigid, and most secure. Security and access are determined by the OS, not the user. Need to know and level clearances.
  * Discretionary Access Control (DAC): Flexible: Dynamic, least secure. Let owners of data specify the user's access/use of data.
  * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access based on groups/functions. Permission is given to all users of a specific role.
  * Rule-Based Access Control: Based on allow/deny lists. States what the user can/cannot do with an ACL.
  * Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Defines permissions based on attributes, and allows for more granularity with specific functions instead of giving access to everyone in that role.
  * Conditional Access: Rules stating assets, users, and levels of authentication required. Specific access rules are needed.
  * Privileged Access Management: Admin or root account w/ privileges to set up controls. Logged, audited, and multiple admins for accountability.
  * Filesystem permission: Permissions for a file or directory in a device OS.
