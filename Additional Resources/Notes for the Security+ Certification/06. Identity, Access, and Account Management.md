# Identity, Access, and Account Management
## 6.1 Access Control Models
* Access Control: the ability to permit/deny access to a resource.
* Access control policy: Defines the measures taken to control access to an object.
* Access Control Systems: Policies, procedures, and tech to control access to the object.
* Objects: Data, apps, systems, networks, and physical assets.
* Subject: Users, applications, or processes that need to access the objects.
* 3 Items needed before access: Identification, Authentication, and Authorization
  * Identification: The user needs to identify with the correct credentials to confirm identity.
  * Authentication: Makes sure that the user is the person that they claimed to be in identification.
  * Authorization: granting permission to an object, determining if the user should be able to access the resource.
* Two-factor authentication (TFA): combining two separate single-factor authentication types.
* Multifactor authentication (MFA): Combines all three single-factor types and is the strongest option
* Single-factor authentication types:
  * Something you are
  * Something you know
  * Something you have
* Accounting/Auditing: Logging a user's activities, resources, and behaviors for analysis and monitoring.
* AAA Server (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting): RADIUS or Diameter
* Access Control Best Practices: Principle of least privilege, implicit deny, MFA, need to know, separation of duties, job rotation, account management, defense in depth.
* Access Control Classifications: Preventative, Detective, Corrective, Deterrent, Recovery, Compensative
* Access Control Restriction types: Administrative, Technical, Physical
* Access Control Schemes:
  * Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Inflexible, rigid, and most secure. The OS, not the user, determines security and access. Need to know and level clearances.
  * Discretionary Access Control (DAC): Flexible: Dynamic, least secure. Let owners of data specify the user's access/use of data.
  * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access based on groups/functions. Permission is given to all users of a specific role.
  * Rule-Based Access Control: Based on allow/deny lists. States what the user can/cannot do with an ACL.
  * Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Defines permissions based on attributes, and allows for more granularity with specific functions instead of giving access to everyone in that role.
  * Conditional Access: Rules stating assets, users, and levels of authentication required. Specific access rules are needed.
  * Privileged Access Management: Admin or root account w/ privileges to set up controls. Logged, audited, and multiple admins for accountability.
  * Filesystem permission: Permissions for a file or directory in a device OS.



## 6.2 Authentication
* Authentication Factors:
  * Something you know: Username, password, pin, something to remember
  * Something you have: ID, smartcard, key, something in your possession
  * Something you are: biometrics - something about you
* Authentication attributes:
  * Somewhere you are: Location-based
  * Something you can do: Unique gesture or pattern
  * Something you Exhibit: Unique trait or neurological pattern/Personality
  * Someone you know: Have someone trusted to validate who you are.
* Identity: a specific person or thing
* Identification: something that validates you are that person.
* Entity: an individual, process, host, service, or network.
* Identity Provider (IdP): creates, maintains, and manages identity info for an org
* IdPs framework: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) to transfer data (frequently)
* Attributes: Items that can allow or disallow access to materials for a subject.
* Certificates: Electronic credentials required by PKI to securitly identify an individual based on public keys.
* Certificate Authority: A trusted part used to sign and issue certificates after identifying identity.
* Token: Software or hardware used to identify a user (usually with a username/password)
* SSH Keys: Lets a user log into a remote system's console securely using PKI
* ID Card: Provides photo validation to identify the owner.
* Smart Card: A card with a chip or strip that contains credentials.
* Directory Services: A repository of info about users and their resources.
* Lightweight Directory Acces Protocol (LDAP): a service protocol for directories (used in Active Directory (AD) w/ Microsoft and OpenLDAP w/ Linux)
* LDAP encryption: can be encrypted with SSL or TLS to make "LDAPS"
* Single Sign-On (SSO): The user is authenticated once for all network resources (set up in user accounts policy)
* Federation: Enterprise-wide identity that carries across the full enterprise - transitive trust
* Attestation: Tells the application the user is legitimate and has been certified (2-way attestation possible)
* OAuth: An auth framework to allow clients to gain access w/ allow or deny authorizations (components: user, client, resource server, auth server)
* OpenID Connect: OAuth 2.0 specifications allow user and client identity verification
* Shibboleth: Web-based and open-source use for SSO, network and internet auth with one credential for many sites, auth with SAML, used by university and public organizations.
* Kerberos: Network Auth used in AD implementations, using tickets and timestamps (to prevent replay attacks)
  * Kerberos Components: Key Distribution Center (KDC), Auth Service (AS), and Ticket-Granting Servier (TGS)
* Biometrics: use a unique physical attribute to identify a user - complex and can cause false permissions and denials
* False Acceptance Rate (FAR)/False Positive: Error when a person is falsely given access
* False Rejection Rate (FRR)/False Negative: When a person that should be accepted is not.
* Crossover error rate: Where the false positives are equal to false negatives in the biometric system
* Processing rate: Number of subject/auth attempts that can be validated
* On-prem solution: Active Directory
* Cloud solution: Azure AD
* HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP): HOTP algorithm used to generate a one-time password to auth using an auth server.
* Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP): HOTP with time-based factor
* Short Message Service (SMS): used to receive a short PIN for auth
* Token key: key inserted to prove identity
* Auth Application: authenticators using TOTP to protect users
* Push Notifications: phones can receive notifications with a code for auth
* Phone call: Phone calls can be used for code entry
* Static codes: codes made by a site to store data, good for retrieving data


## 6.3 Authorization
* Authorization: The process of controlling access to a resource
* Access Control List (ACL): A list of identities that can access an object.
* Permission: Controls the type of access allowed.
* Discretionary ACL (DACL): Implementation of Discretionary Access Control (DAC) where an owner adds users/groups to the DACL and identifies object permissions.
* System ACL (SACL): Microsoft's ACL for auditing past options on an object.
* Security Principal: A person, device, or group that can be permitted for an object.
* Each principal is given a Security ID (SID), user then gets a security token for accessing resources, when accessing resources the token is checked.
* Effective Permissions: If a member of two groups, the user has both group's permissions.
* Deny Permissions: disallow access and override Allow permissions.
