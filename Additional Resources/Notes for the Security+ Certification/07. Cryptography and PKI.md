# Cryptography and PKI
## 7.1 Cryptography
* cryptography: The practice and study of hiding information
* Cryptanalysis: Analysing and finding some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme
* Encryption: Taking data and turning it into an unreadable form (Plaintext -> Cyphertext)
* Cryptology: Cryptography and cryptanalysis
* Plaintext: The readable form of data before encryption
* Ciphertext: Data after encrypted (not readable)
* Decryption: Method of turning ciphertext into plaintext
* Encryption Cipher/Algorithm: Rules/procedures to encrypt or decrypt data
* Key/Cryptovariable: A value used tint encryption
* Keyspace: The length of bits that a key takes up - longer ones means less opportinity duplicates
* Historical Encryption Usages:
  * Substitution: changing one character for another
  * Ceaser cipher: Shifting all letters to a specific number of spaces.
  * ROT-13: Rotates letters 13 spaces
  * Vigenere Table: shifting letters a specific amount based on the letters of a key.
* Provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and/or non-repudiation 


## 7.2 Implementations
* Confidentiality: Ensuring data is made available to authorized people only.
* Integrity: The protection from information being altered in some way.
* Hashing: often used to create signatures for files showing if it's been edited.
* Authentication: Validating the user is who they claim to be. Done through electronic signatures or other forms of ID
* Non-repudiation: the ability to prove the origin of a signature or document (un-deniable)
* Obfuscation: Security through obscurity, making the data unreadable to a human or program. (Ex. XXX-XXX-XXX-1234 credit card number)
* Cryptographic Considerations:
  * Security Constraints: ciphers need hardware to support computing power. Hardware must be ataquit
  * Speed: Different algorithms take different time lengths to perform
  * Different lengths: Different key, different key size
  * Weak keys: some keys are weaker than others and should not be used
  * Longevity: Some keys are one-time and some can be used for longer
  * Entropy (randomness): By adding in a salt, this can reduce predictability
  * Reuse: Improper rescue of keys can cause weaknesses
  * Computational Overloads: Some keys need more computation than what is available for the device.
* Confusion: cyphertext is dependent on many parts of the key making a more thorough encryption process
* Diffusion: a small change can change the entire string of variables.
* Substitution: changing letters using many alphabets and changes
* Transposition: the characters are rearranged through a mathematical process.
* Symmetric Keys: encryption where both parties use the same key for encryption and decryption
* Symmetric Keys Advantages and Disadvantages:
  * This only works if the users are able to protect the secret key
  * Doesn't scale up well
  * The system needs a secure way to distribute the keys
  * only offers confidentiality
  * Difficult to crack with a larger key
  * Faster than asymmetric encryption
* Symmetric Cryptography Types:
  * Stream Cypher: Encrypts one bit of data at a time (faster than block, uses random IV with XOR and key, uses RC4 and WEP)
  * Block Cypher: Encrypts entire blocks of data and not a single bit at a time (usually 64 bits, uses DES, 3DES, AES, Rijndael, Blowfish, or Twofish)
* Modes of Operation: 
  * Electronic Codebook (ECB): Confidentiality mode cyphertext with plaintext blocks (not used much anymore and susceptible to replay attacks)
  * Cypher Block Chaining (CBC): Confidentiality mode that involves chaining plaintext blocks to the previous ciphertext (requires IV to combine with first plaintext block)
  * Cypher Feedback (CFB): Confidentiality mode that users segments of cyphertext to create blocks that are then XORed with plaintext (requires IV with the first block)
  * Output Feedback (OFB): Confidentiality mode using forward cipher on an IV to make output blocks XORed with plaintext to make ciphertext (IV is a nonce)
  * Counter: Confidentiality mode combining forward cipher and input blocks to make output blocks XORed with plaintext to produce cyphertext
  * Galois Counter Mode (GCM): Confidentiality mode using a variation of Counter encryption - can also provide authentication for unencrypted data
* Block Cipher w/ 64 bit: DES, 3DES, Blowfish
* Block Cipher w/ 128 bit: AES, Twofish
* Streaming Cipher: RC4
* Asymmetric Encryption: Everyone has a pair (2) of mathematically related keys (private and public) - the sender uses the public key of the receiver to encrypt, receiver decrypts with the public key.
* Key Escrow: A third party holds a special third key used to encrypt the private key, this can be used to unlock the copy of the private key if it is lost or stolen.
* Asymmetric Encryption Advantages and Disadvantages:
  * Authentication and non-repudiation
  * More manageable & scalable way to deal with keys
  * Slower than Symmetric
* Asymmetric Encryption Types: RSA, Elliptic Curve, Diffie-Hellman, & DSA
  * Elliptic Curve - uses the algebraic structure of elliptic curves, lightweight (good for IoT and limited resources devices)
  * RSA: The most well-known encryption created in 1977 and the 2048-bit version is secure
* Out-of-band key exchange: not sent over the network (some other way)
* In-Band key exchange: Key communicated over the network when the session begins. (one-time key created in real-time)
* Ephemeral Keys: temporary keys
* Static Keys: Keys with a longer lifespan (usually 1-2 years)
* Secret Key Benefit: If the secret key is leaked, the other messages encrypted by the system are still secure (PFS)
* Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS): Architecture used to keep the system secure if a key is leaked. One leaked key does not compromise the entire system.
* Random/Pseudo-Random Numbers/Inputs:
  * Salt: Randomly generated input with some hashing scheme
  * Initialization Vector (IV): Used to be sure that if the same block is transmitted the ciphertext will be different. Block and Steam Ciphers use IVs.
  * Nonces: One-time number, sometimes using a salt, can be random/pseudo-random. Can be vulnerable to replay attacks.
* Key stretching: Strengthen a weak key by increasing the length of the key through Password-Bassed Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) and bcrypt.
* Post-Quantum Cryptography: Algorithms that can remain secure against quantum computing - usually referring to asymmetric encryption.
* Homomorphic Encryption: Deals with the protection of data-in-transit. This involves data being processed as well as data at rest.
* Steganography: This does not include algorithms to encrypt data, but contains data within the data of an image. Uses bitmap (BMP), watermark, and unused sections of disks, as long as it does not affect the original image.
* Blockchain: Publically accessible ledgers that record online peer-to-peer interactions. All the systems in the chain validate transactions - the longer the chain, the more validity that transaction holds - usually used for crypto transactions
