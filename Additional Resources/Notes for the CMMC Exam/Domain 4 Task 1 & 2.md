# Domain 4 Task 1 & 2
## Understanding and Defining Scoping:
### Define Organizational Scoping: 
* Scope is dependent on the level of assessment done.
* Several items will assist in CCP consultant or assessor in determining the scope.
* Scopting for OSC depends on many things, but mostly Cost and Level.
* Some OSC will have the entire company in scope or a specific part of the company in scope and the rest excluded.
* When assessed by a C3PAO, the OSC must define what part of the OSC is in/out of scope.
* There are three designations scoping units:
  * Headquarters (HQ) Organizational Unit: The legal entity that will deliver info/products under the DoD contract. This can be the OSC or can make the host unit the OSC.
  * Host Units: This can be the same as the HQ Org. Unit: People, process, and technology applied to the DoD contract and is the OSC.
    * This is called 'enclaving' and is only when the FCI/CUI is separate from the HQ org's info system
    * In other cases the HQ system would be in scope for the assessment
  * Supporting Units: People, process, or technology supporting the host unit, but would not get the CMMC Certification, including:
    * Subcontractors
    * External Service Providers
    * Third Party Service Providers
    * Managed Service Providers
##### Organization
* CMMC Assessment Process gives additional info on this
  * It's an HQ org or OSC registered at ```SAM.gov``` and issued a UEI and CAGE code.
* The CAP gives additional info:  
  * The legal entity delivering the service under DoD contract
  * Can be the HQ org or the OSC
  * Must be directly linked to the SSP (System Security Plan) and protect FCI or CUI
##### Host Unit
* Resources in the same security domain, providing protection.
* This will be 'walled-off' from other networks/systems for security.
* FCI/CUI must be documented by the contractor, containing:
  * Asset Inventory
  * SSP
  * Network Diagram of the Assessment Scope 
##### Supporting Units
* Level 1 Assessments have Supporting Units playing a part in the assessment
* Level 2 Assessments have a section dedicated to External Service Providers (ESP).
* This is called the "External Service Provider Considerations," and applies considerations to ESP relationships like:
  * Evaluating the ESP's shared responsibility matrix (security control objectives and providers responsibilities)
  * Consider the standards the ESP conforms to
  * Consider the agreements in place (SLAs, Memo of understanding, contracts)
