# Phase 1 – Pre-Assessment Preparation

---

## Initial Assessment Preparation

### Receive Assessment Request
- Receive CMMC assessment request from the OSC.

---

### Establish Roles and Responsibilities
- Define responsibilities for:
  - C3PAO personnel
  - Assessment team members
  - OSC participants

---

### Organize Assessment Documentation
Prepare:

- Assessment templates
- Planning documentation
- Evidence tracking mechanisms

---

### Ascertain Assessment Conditions and Requirements

#### Requirements
- Derived from **NIST SP 800-171A**

#### Conditions
Assessment can be:

- Virtual
- In-person
- Hybrid (most common currently)

> CAP 5.6.1 states at least some in-person participation is required.  
> This requirement is considered outdated compared to current practice.

---

### Frame the Assessment
Determine:

- Assessment methodology
- Evidence collection approach
- Organizational readiness prior to starting the assessment

---

### Identify Lead Assessor
- Selected internally by the C3PAO.

---

### Confirm Corporate Identity
Verify:

- Organization name
- Assessment scope
- Entities being assessed
- CAGE codes

This can be completed:
- Virtually
- In person

Must be completed prior to assessment execution.

---

### Understand Corporate Identity
- Gain full understanding of organizational structure and governance.

---

### Validate Assessment Scope
- Confirm accuracy of OSC-provided scope.
- Ensure all applicable assets are included.

---

### Evaluate Model Non-Duplication
- Ensure duplicate control coverage is avoided.

---

### Inventory OSC Cybersecurity Practices
Primarily involves reviewing the:

- **System Security Plan (SSP)**

The SSP must include:
- Implementation statements for each control.

---

### Verify and Record Evidence
Assess:

- Adequacy
- Sufficiency
- Applicability

Phase 1 verifies evidence exists.

Phase 2 validates evidence through:
- Interviews
- Demonstrations
- Real-time report generation  
  (Example: Active Directory or Intune reporting)

---

### Complete Pre-Assessment Planning
Includes:

- Evidence collection strategy
- Resource allocation
- Scheduling

---

### Select Assessment Team
- Selected internally by the C3PAO.

---

### Identify Resources and Schedule
Determine:

- Personnel availability
- Technical resources
- Assessment timeline

---

### Manage Conflicts of Interest (COI)
Ensure:
- C3PAO personnel have not previously supported or consulted for the OSC.

---

### Verify Assessment Readiness
Confirm OSC preparedness.

---

### Establish Evidence Repository
- Provide shared location accessible by both OSC and C3PAO.

---

### Determine Assessment Feasibility
Confirm assessment can be successfully performed.

---

### Conduct Quality Review
- Validate Pre-Assessment Form data.

---

### Upload Pre-Assessment Form to CMMC eMASS
- Upload planning documentation.
- Updated plans must be re-uploaded.

---

### Prepare Assessment Team
Historical expectation:
- 4–5 assessors

Current minimum:
- 2 Certified CMMC Assessors (CCA)
- One must be Lead CCA

---

### Execute Contractual Agreement
- Formal agreement between C3PAO and OSC.

---

## Additional Phase 1 Guidance

---

### CAGE Code Requirements
- Each assessed entity requires a CAGE code.
- Parent organizations may also require codes.
- Joint ventures require codes for each governing entity.

CAGE codes:
- Obtained via **SAM.gov**
- Currently limited to five characters.
- Replacement processes are being developed.

---

### OSC Responsibilities
OSC must initially define assessment scope including:

- Asset inventory
- Network environment boundaries

Supporting documentation provided to Lead Assessor:

- Network diagrams
- SSP
- Policies
- Organizational charts

Lead Assessor verifies scope integrity.

---

### Preliminary Evidence Examples

#### Documents
- SSP (**Required — No SSP = No Assessment**)
- Policies
- Procedures
- Security Assessment Plans
- Security Assessment Reports
- Incident Response Plans
- Risk Assessment Reports
- System configurations

#### Inventories
- CUI inventories

#### Assets
- Security Protection Assets
- Contractor Risk Managed Assets
- Specialized Assets

#### Additional Evidence
- Screen shares
- Audit logs
- Artifacts
- Physical inspections

# Phase 2 – Assessment Execution

---

## Conduct Kickoff Meeting
- Establish communication expectations.
- Confirm scope and logistics.

---

## Collect and Examine Evidence
- Most evidence should already be provided.
- Avoid requesting unnecessary information.

---

## Analyze Evidence
- Evaluate adequacy and accuracy.

---

## Conduct Interviews
- Ask follow-up questions.
- Allow silent documentation time for assessors.

---

## Observe Testing
Includes:

- Automated tool outputs
- Real-time evidence reproduction
- Additional evidence requests when necessary

---

## Identify Evidence Gaps

Some gaps may be closed by additional evidence.

### Important Rules
- Organizations **cannot fix controls during the assessment**.
- Minor corrections may be acceptable:
  - Typo corrections
  - Regenerating reports

Examples likely NOT acceptable:
- Updating access listings
- Implementing MFA during assessment

---

## Update Evidence Review Status
- Track evidence progress and completeness.

---
