# Securing Data and Applications
## 10.1 Data Transmission Security
##### Protocols and use cases:
* DNSSEC: Voice and Video
* SSH: Time Synchronization (Port 22) used for tunneling and signing into remote hosts.
* S/MIME: Email and Web - Public Key Encryption - provides auth, integrity, non-repudiation, and confidentiality. 
* SRTP: File transfer - can secure VoIP
* LDAPS: Directory services (Port 636) - uses AD and needs a certificate to use
* FTPS: Remote access and secure file transfer (Port 989 and 990)
* SFTP: Remote file transfer and access management (Port 22)
* SNMPv3: Domain Name resolution and reporting IP devices
* SSL/TLS: Routing and switching - secure connection using Diffie-Hellman w/ session key. (TLS is the newer version with 7 step handshake)
* Secure POP/IMAP: network address allocation and subscription services, mail clients, (POP - Port TCP 110/SSL 995) (IMAP - Port TCP 143/SSL 993)
* IP: Connectionless protocol for network addressing and routing packets over a network.
* IPSec: suite of protocols to auth IP traffic
  * AH: Hashing to share a key to ensure data integrity
  * ESP: Transport or tunnel most to encapsulate data payload and ensure security
* TCP: Establishes connection between endpoints and guarantees delivery of packets
* UDP: Connectionless protocol with no guarantee of delivery.
* TCP Handshake: Used to establish a connection (SYN ->, SYN/ACK <-, ACK ->)
* Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC): Used to add security to DNS with digital signatures, no confidentiality but is used for chain of trust and no changes to data
* HTTPS: Relies on TLS for authentication and privacy over the internet, prevents MitM and eavesdropping (Post 443)

* Secure Ports and Port Numbers
* DNSSEC UDP/TCP: 53
* FTPS TCP: 21 in explicit mode, 990 in implicit mode
* SFTP TCP: 22 (SSH) Using SSH
* HTTPS TCP: 443 Using TLS
* IMAP3 TCP: 993 Using TLS
* LDAPS TCP: 636 Using TLS
* POP3 TCP: 995 â€“ Secure POP3 Using TLS
* SRTP UDP: 5004
* SNMPv3 UDP: 161 and 162
* SSH TCP: 22

## 10.2 Data Protection
* Data Loss Prevention: Using security to prevent confidential data from leaving an organization's network. (banking info, PHI, PII, records)
* Network DLP: A software or hardware solution that is installed near the network perimeter to analyze the network traffic to find sensitive data in violation of an org's security policies
* Endpoint DLP: Sofware running on the end user's workstation
* File-Level DLP: Software used to find sensitive files on the network embeds the security policy for when it is moved or copied.
* Information Rights Management (IRM): Business-to-business secure transfers of data
* Cloud DLP: Analyses traffic to/from the cloud for sensitive data (can be harder to monitor if transferred within the cloud.)
* Data Masking: Taking sensitive data and masking it with a different value
* Tokenization: replaces sensitive data with a token of random digits and letters to refer to the data
* Encryption: Process of changing plaintext into something that can be unreadable but retrievable.
* Digital Rights Management (DRM): Embed watermark into the document to prevent data copy.
* Dynamic Data Masking: Replaces the data information with something mimicking the original making it useful for data processing - the original can be retrieved
* Static Data Masking: Data at rest in a database or just a field or column
* IRM: Protects the data at a file level, embeds security policies, allows policies to move with a file, and allows controlled access to a file even outside of the company's system.
